**Digital marketing is hard**. Social, search, paid, influencers, referrals and a ton of other stuff to stay upto date with constantly. What's even harder is doing digital marketing well enough to build a successful brand.

We're building out this blog because there is a real lack of structured marketing content built specifically for consumer brands.

> Marketing a brand is part art and part science. We'll explain both.


## About Me
... dramatic music plays ...

I'm an engineer turned digital marketer for a sports brand in Mumbai. I have had the good fortune to be mentored directly by my co-founder who is amazing at marketing.

I began my journey, as most people do, with tons of learning. Blogs. Articles. Youtube videos. You name it. The biggest challenge was staying upto date with the whole ecosystem. But with new strategies and new tools being launched everyday, this is by no means an easy feat.

I needed a constant source of information. Something to help me stay upto date with D2C marketing... I never found it.

And this is exactly what I want to solve for the marketers that are building
[India's future $100 billion D2C market](https://inc42.com/reports/decoding-indias-100-bn-d2c-opportunity-market-landscape-and-trends-report-2021/).


## So What's This Blog About?
This blog is our way to help budding consumer brand marketers and founders to learn the best practices and stay up-to-date with the latest in digital marketing.

We will cover everything from Facebook Ads to emails. And even breakdown PPC, SMM, SEM and a bunch of other topics into simple, actionable, bite sized pieces for you to understand.

Brands also needs different strategies at different times. Something that works for a huge brand may not work out for a younger one. We'll provide you with different strategies based on scale to help you grow sustainably.
